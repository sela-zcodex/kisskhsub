I hope you stay committed to your ordination.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.530
A loser like you ever thought about ordaining?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.410
Damn.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.720
Are you asking me or just trying to diss me?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.590
I'm just curious.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.190
Someone like me?

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.800
If I ever think about ordaining,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670
it'll be when a jerk like you's dead.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.300
This one.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.280
Cool.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.050
Are you gonna take it all?

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.900
I’ll take this one, it’s so flavorful.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.260
Wanna take some jackfruit too?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.140
That's not good.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.140
You're so picky.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.400
Arm!

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.870
Yes.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.480
This one too.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.760
Okay.

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:07.900
I think you should take this one too.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.430
Jerk Arm!

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.950
What's up? Yot.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.640
Take that one too.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.640
Which one?

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.400
As you can see, there are so many of them.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.410
That one.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.130
This one?

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.850
Or...

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.060
This one?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.320
Are you trying to piss me off?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.290
Hey.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.530
No way, how would I piss you off?

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.430
Yeah, that green one.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.930
This one, right?

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.920
Seems like you've been missing my feet this morning.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.360
Hurry up, let's go eat.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.940
Okay.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.720
Joon.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.790
Don't forget to clean up, Granny.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.550
Well.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.540
I'm taking my leave, Reverend Father.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.830
I'll hurry back soon.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.840
My dear Joon.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.530
Don't take too much MSG.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.510
You have almost no hair left on your head.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.680
I'm taking my leave, Reverend Father.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.650
Wow.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.260
Fancy moves.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.860
Whoa bro, what happened to your bike?

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.460
My balls are about to boil!

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.020
I'm so hungry!

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.829
Arm, plate it up.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.720
I'm hungry, damn.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.390
Okay, Yot.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.220
Ouch! Damn!

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.130
What the hell are you guys doing?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.600
M. Fuck.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.840
You stay in my room and grinding on my body pillow?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.160
Take it, I don't want this shit anymore.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.410
Disgusting.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.300
You're overreacting. Huh?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.380
It's just your stinky body pillow.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.620
I was just dozing off,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.030
grinding on the body pillow a little

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.550
to feel some pleasure.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.920
I didn't cum on your body pillow.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.970
Just grinding?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.400
Fuck!

00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:53.800
Forget about your food.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.910
Annoying.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.420
Arm.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.700
Why, M?

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.090
Please wash Yot's stinky body pillow for me.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.080
I'll take a shower and follow you to eat.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.800
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.690
Seriously.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.020
What would you do if my balls got scalded by your food?

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.440
You'll end up sterile,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.590
so you won't need a wife.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.020
Huh? You bastard!

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.460
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.120
M.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.790
We've known each other for a long time,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.810
but why aren't you dating anyone yet?

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.100
Why the fuck are you messing with me?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.880
Or...

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.910
is the reason you don't date anyone

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.310
because...

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.230
you're really sterile?

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.140
Fuck!

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.060
Where'd you get that filthy mouth from?

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.940
Go away from my feet.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.830
Come on, getting ready. That orange.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.310
So we can eat.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.740
Ouch!

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.780
M.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.740
You wanna fight?

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.000
- Come on. You were the one who started it.
- Damn.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.490
You wanna fight?

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.220
You wanna fight with me?

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.220
Damn.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.420
M!

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.560
Top me up.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.550
Want a strong one?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.170
Yeah, fill it up.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.580
Stop. That's enough.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.770
Damn. Soda...

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.350
As I expected. Hey!

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.200
Even if the world's falling apart, you'd still be drinking, huh?

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.840
Will you guys die if you don't drink for one day?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.460
Just like you.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.259
You gonna die if you don't play poker for one day?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.820
You little bastard!

00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:57.860
Calm down.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.910
I apologize on behalf of Yot.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.980
Hey.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.150
Can you just do something I can brag to the auntie next door?

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.780
Her kid has a degree now, did you hear?

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.080
They're top-class students.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.990
They even got scholarships to continue their studies in Switzerland.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.880
Let him be the light switch for now.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.610
Vroom vroom!

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.810
I beg you.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.450
If you can't make me proud,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.310
can you at least go ordain like other sons?

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.990
Huh?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.550
At least when I die, I'll get to go to heaven.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.760
Hey, Mom.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.670
Why?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.899
Even if I ordain, you still think you'll get into heaven?

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.040
You ungrateful bastard!

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.399
Still drinking? Cut it out!

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.220
- Mom.
- What!?

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.040
Hey!

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.160
Get back to your work now!

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.350
If you're not going to ordain, go back to repairing the car!

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.330
Yep!

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.150
'Yep?'

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.160
Take this! Yep?

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.900
Stop barking!

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.220
Hey!

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.410
You guys still drinking?

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:05.970
Huh?

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.260
Did you catch how I was scolding him?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.319
So annoying!

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.320
The dog barking is already irritating, and my son keeps annoying me.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.700
Eat faster, that spoon's gone flying.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.940
We should hurry and scoop it all.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:17.880
Yeah.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.180
Geez, still working on the repairs?

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.420
As expected.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.770
Excuse me.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.260
Is anyone here?

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.440
I need to know when my car will be finished.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.140
Every time I come here, he just keep telling me it's not ready!

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.080
When will it be done, seriously? I'm really curious.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.600
Is anyone here?

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.780
Is no one working at this garage?

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.760
Oh.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.330
Your tank top looks just like mine.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.080
You are so handsome.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.890
When will my car be ready?

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.180
When will you CUM to pick it up?

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.889
Cum is a good idea.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.750
But I'm not in a hurry today.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.370
Please take your time. It's okay.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.650
I'll CUM to pick up the car later.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.870
Thank you.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.709
I'm sorry for rushing my words earlier.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.850
It's not good.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.340
I'm sorry.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.810
Bye bye.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.300
Don't rush, it's okay.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.120
Hurry up and CUM get your car.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.370
Of course, I will CUM.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.900
Two weeks is still okay.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.539
One month.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.610
One month is fine.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.420
Thank you.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.100
Hey, M.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.830
Have you seen that client before?

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.050
Sure.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.340
She brought the car for repairs while you were not around.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:02.860
Damn.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.980
Why didn't you tell me sooner there was such a hot client?

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.740
So I could've inspected her UNDERcarriage.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.220
Hey.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.690
Or maybe you...

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.190
What?

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.340
Had your eye on her, so you kept it from me?

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.760
Not at all.

00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:25.880
Aha, your face is turning red!

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.490
What the hell dumb crap is that?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.340
You're just as annoying as hell.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.450
If you like her, I can step aside.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.730
So that you don't have to grind on my body pillow.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.060
That's enough.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.600
What the hell are you talking about?

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.230
My girlfriend just video called me.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.540
I'll be right back, friend.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.590
You have sharp eyes.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.050
Hurry up and follow her.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.479
Hello, babe.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.890
Why do you take so long to answer my call?

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.849
Hi, babe.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.760
What are you doing?

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.420
Why did you call me?

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.860
Babe, what are you doing? Getting ready to shower?

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.780
Yes, I'm going to take a shower.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.490
Why did you call me, babe?

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.279
Hey, Yot...

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.730
I just want to ask for 2,000 baht to get my nails done.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.160
How the hell did your nails cost 2,000 baht?

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.859
Hey, it's only 2,000 baht.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.300
Will you give me the money?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.880
I can.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.420
But...

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.160
don't you have anything to exchange?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.710
What would you like, babe?

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.080
Can we have phone sex?

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.280
Phone sex?

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.120
That's okay.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.510
But can you transfer the money to me first?

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.430
Just a moment.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.620
Okay.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.900
Wow. Thank you, Yot.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.410
Okay. Let's...

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.500
Damn it.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.610
Damn, you totally left me hanging.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.830
I won't pay in advance next time.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:26.820
Damn.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.430
Damn.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.130
So, how is it?

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.890
Jiji is showing her boobs to exchange money again, right?

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.740
You really know her well.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.700
Fuck.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.720
I have been with you for a long time.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.070
I know your true nature well.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.260
Jiji doesn't come to see you?

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.940
Fuck it.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.180
Don't let me know that she talked to Noh.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.220
Otherwise, I will definitely stomp on them.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.100
Hey.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.360
Calm down.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.040
Damn it.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.570
She left me hanging.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:07.450
Hey.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.630
Then...

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:10.700
How about this?

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.830
Here.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.980
Shit!

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.600
She's fire.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.580
Where?

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.210
Seriously, Reverend Father...

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.530
I am the one who has to listen to his whining.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.030
Otherwise, he wouldn't share his food with me.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.110
It's good for you.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.850
So that you can be a good person like other people.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.870
Hey.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.150
But I think it would be good if Yot ordained.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.960
Arm, shut up.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.180
Better watch out or you'll get your ass kicked before you get to drink, bastard!

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.110
Yes.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.130
What the hell are you saying?

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.610
Don't forget to bring your brain out of your mom's womb.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.000
Come to think of it,

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.669
a loser like you ever thought about ordaining?

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.650
Damn.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.890
Are you asking me or just trying to diss me?

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.780
I'm just curious.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.940
Yeah, I'm fucking cu...

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.510
I'm curious too.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.370
Arm said it already.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.420
Someone like me?

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.150
If I ever think about ordaining,

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.780
it'll be when a jerk like you's dead.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.500
Even though I tried to keep quiet.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.080
If you wait for your jerk friend to die,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.650
you'll never get ordained.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.110
Why, Mom?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.050
You're saying he doesn't die easily, right?

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.260
I guess so.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.940
I guess I'll have to take care of his meals and housing for the rest of my life.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.820
Maybe I'll die before him.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.950
So that you can ordain the deceased for me.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.350
Mom!

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.020
Stop talking nonsense!

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.620
Where is the nonsense?

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.200
Tell me,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.220
how many days do you work in a week?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.060
Have you noticed how often you drink every week?

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.960
Isn't it me who's breaking my back to raise you and even your friends?

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.210
Is it too much to ask for you to ordain for your mother?

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.840
I used to doubt it,

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.160
But I already knew why Dad left you.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:38.990
Why?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.290
It's because your logic is totally sick!

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.980
Do you really know why your dad left me?

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.600
What about you?

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.000
How are you different from your dad?

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.370
Acting like a fucking asshole with disgusting attitude.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.639
Don't talk about my dad like that!

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.300
Why?

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.939
What makes you think you're better than my dad?!

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.119
Answer me!

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.600
Yot!

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.850
Damn it!

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.450
Don't grab me!

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.360
You're my mom, so what?

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.630
It doesn't change the fact that you're just as fucked up as me.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.220
All you do is play poker all day.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.260
You actually dare to demand gratitude?

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.590
You say you provide me with food and water?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.060
Actually, the temple feeds us better than my mom ever has!

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.390
Yot!

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.400
Arm!

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:19.980
Take her into the house.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.590
Don't mess with me!

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.000
Stay here all you fucking want.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.560
I'm gonna go play poker!

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.320
See? You ended up going to play poker anyway!

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.100
Even though I thought you wanted to be with me.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.630
Damn it.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.430
Are you okay?

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.780
Let's cheers.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.610
You guys are like this every time after arguing.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.400
Yes.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.540
It seems like it's worse than ever this time.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.230
Yeah.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.180
Hi, y'all?

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.880
You guys drank all night again, didn't you?

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.840
Do you have any food, Jiji?

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.300
Yeah. Did you bring any food?

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.430
Kiddo. If you're hungry, order delivery.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.740
I'm carrying so much stuff,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.730
do you still expect me to bring food?

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.320
Uh, by the way.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.640
I just got my nails done. Do they look nice?

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.060
Babe, look.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.940
Do my nails look pretty, babe?

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.360
Kao almost screamed after seeing my nails.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:22.100
Her husband probably doesn't have the money to let her get her nails done like my Yot, right?

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.700
You're arguing with your mom again, right?

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.960
Yot.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.309
Your mom says the same thing every day.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.060
You really don't need to take it to heart.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.370
Look at me.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.030
I used your money for my hair and facial treatments.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.600
Am I pretty? Tell me, please.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.610
Yeah.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.290
I'm so tired. I've been shopping all day.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.309
I feel so sticky.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.370
I feel uncomfortable.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.650
I want to take a shower.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.520
Can you go alone?

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.880
No, I'm afraid of ghosts.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.500
Can you come take a shower with me, Yot?

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.990
I don't want to shower alone.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.070
Sure, babe.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.530
Let's go shower together.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.180
"Let's go shower together"

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.210
"Let's go shower together"

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.210
"Sure, babe"

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.540
I'm gonna puke!

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.200
"Do my nails look pretty, babe?"

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.170
So much.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.850
Arm.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.130
I think we should sleep here tonight.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.660
Seems like it's gonna take them a long time.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.130
That's okay.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.100
I'd rather go back and sleep at the temple.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.910
Hey, you bastard!

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.370
You ditched me again!

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.750
If I ditch you, I won't have any friends left.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.940
Your friend is the Reverend Father.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.340
I'm going now.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.450
See you.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.070
You always ditch me.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.450
I'm just going with the best choice.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.190
Arm.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.340
I'll go with you.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.460
I'll drop you off.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.000
Don't be late.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.060
Otherwise, I won't wait for you.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.560
"Shower together"

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.230
"Sure, babe"

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.850
Hey!

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.070
Is Yim home?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.300
No.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.760
Where did she go?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.200
How do I know?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.700
I'm not glued to her.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.320
Watch that mouth, man.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.310
You're begging to get smacked.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.020
Who are you? Why are you looking for my mom?

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.440
Oh, you are her son?

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.210
Tell your mom to pay what she owes my boss.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.930
Damn, I thought it was something more serious.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.220
How much does my mom owe your boss?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.480
Listen.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.330
200,000.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.260
Are you crazy?

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.410
200,000?

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.450
Are you charging too much interest?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.820
200,000 is just the principal amount.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.940
My boss was kind enough to let your mom pay back just the principal.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.540
But she has to pay him back immediately.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.340
If she doesn't pay up, this garage is DONE!

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.940
Hey, don't touch anything here.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.060
This is my dad's garage.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.190
It's irrelevant.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.530
If you mess with my dad's garage,

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.740
you'll regret it.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.700
Regret?

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.270
You're really mouthy.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.620
Mouthy.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.090
Mouthy.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.220
Man.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.360
You're really mouthy just now, huh?

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.350
You're really mouthy.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.070
Tell your mom.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.660
Pay off my boss's debt.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.080
Got it?

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.790
Hey!

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.700
What the fuck did you do to my friend?

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.140
Yot!

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:40.900
Yot!

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.020
Shit. What the hell happened?

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.860
Slowly. Get up slowly.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.000
Are you okay?

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:58.840
Jiji!

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.280
Jiji! Help him quickly!

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.600
Screw it.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.690
She's been out there partying around since early today anyway.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.420
Damn it!

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.370
Let's go.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.300
Go sit over there.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.580
I'll clean your wound.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.920
Get up slowly.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.060
Are you okay?

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.960
Can you walk?

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.220
Be careful.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.860
Shit. Who is he?

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.200
Who are they?

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:49.820
He gave you a serious beating.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.170
The loan sharks came to collect my mother's debt.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.450
You don't have to treat my wound.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.060
I'm okay.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.300
What the hell do you mean?

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.130
Look at you now.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:12.780
Just stay quiet.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.100
Ouch.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:19.970
Shit.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.120
Be gentle.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:23.950
Yeah.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.620
I tried my best to be gentle.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.940
I don't even treat wounds on dogs and cats this extensively.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.110
This is the best I'm capable of.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.779
Are you comparing me to a dog?

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.540
Huh?

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.120
It's because you pissed him off with your smart-ass attitude.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.950
That's why you got your ass kicked.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.060
Next time, learn to shut the hell up.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.980
Don't get cocky.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.900
Damn. There is no wound there.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.100
No wound my ass. Your wound is so red.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.170
Huh?

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.830
You've been fighting again, huh?

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.240
You never stop causing trouble, Yot.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.620
I got into it with the guy you owe money to.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.750
He's going to trash Dad's garage.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.060
What?

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.310
Your loan sharks.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.170
They're here for the 200,000 baht you borrowed just to waste on poker.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.690
They will trash Dad's garage if you don't return their money.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.400
I'm screwed.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.080
What should I do?

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.660
Huh?

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.920
Why didn't you ever tell me?

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.480
It's not something I should tell you.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.290
Got it!

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.590
I've got an idea!

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.740
Yot.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.290
You have to ordain for me.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.660
What the hell are you talking about?

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:42.990
I don't care.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.770
I'm not asking you to ordain so I can get to heaven anymore,

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.070
But I need some of the donation from your ordination

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.940
to pay off some of my debts.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.930
Mom!

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.810
At least the donation from your ordination is enough to pay off some of my debt.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.040
It's better than getting shit all.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.940
Hold on!

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.230
You are going to the temple, right?

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.060
Yot!

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.590
Yot!

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.230
You are going to the temple, right?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.940
Oh. M.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.190
You guys are...

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.110
It's so fucking annoying.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.310
He is really ungrateful.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.980
Loan shark’s about to show up,

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.550
and I lost again at poker.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.570
What should I do?

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.420
Are you still hurt? Are you okay?

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.760
Just a little bit.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.980
Do you want some plaster?

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.540
It's okay, it's just a minor injury.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.020
Life fucking sucks.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.460
Hey.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.740
Could you give me a rollie?

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.570
Thank you so much

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.540
for always being by my side.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.510
Yeah.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:57.600
In my life,

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.080
other than my dad's garage,

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:02.680
I only have you

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.010
as my safe zone.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:17.660
Uh.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.260
I think I won't go home for 3-4 days.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.020
I think I'll stay at Jiji's house for a while.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.570
Are you okay?

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.170
Should I take you there?

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.940
That's okay.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.620
I'll just call a ride myself.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.710
Yeah.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.580
Bye.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.860
You're not going back to get your clothes, are you?

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.080
No.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.380
I don't want to see Mom right now.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.220
I can wear the same clothes or wash them.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.040
See you. Bye.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:04.870
Yeah.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.110
When will jerk M come?

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.300
Yeah.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.340
Jerk Yot, bro.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.000
If you call me that, don't call me bro.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.500
Oh, you gave me permission, you son of a bitch Yot.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.640
Don't you respect your seniors, you asshole?

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.160
Jiji too. She didn't reply to my messages.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:05.610
Let's cheers.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.710
Bottoms up, damn.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.110
Oh, dude.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.340
Hey!

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.840
You're drunk.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.140
The musician took so long to arrive, we were all hammered already.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.459
You must be punished. 10 seconds.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.380
10 seconds?

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.140
Yeah.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.310
10 seconds. Why are you guys in such a hurry to get drunk?

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:30.850
Huh?

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.060
My ass. We're drunk.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.100
We are not in a hurry. You are late.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.040
Come on.

00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:38.740
You're so annoying, Arm. Damn.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:40.990
Hey.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.870
10 seconds?

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.810
Damn.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.500
Is it really 10 seconds?

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.120
No one is timing it.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.540
I'm sorry.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.630
Damn.

00:31:56.631 --> 00:31:58.240
10 seconds, but almost half the bottle is gone.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.780
Jerk M, please put some ice in my glass.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:03.860
Okay.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.570
Now I'm catching up with you guys.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.020
Because you are late.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.030
Cheers.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.860
Wait for me.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.470
I'll take it straight.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.230
Yeah.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.030
What's she doing? Why isn't she picking up?

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.560
Yot.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.690
The hell's wrong with you? You horny?

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.310
Take care of your gang leader.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.370
What the hell are you gonna do with me, huh?

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.280
I'm getting irritated now.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:13.720
Damn.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.230
Damn it.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.500
Hey.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.260
Calm down.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.440
Yeah.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.960
Calm down, bro.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.240
Jiji will call you back soon.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.800
Damn.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.830
We started with three, but now there's just two of us.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:32.940
Come on. Cheers.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.640
Bottoms up.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.080
Yot!

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.800
I'll play some music to cheer you up, dude.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:45.920
Well, ready?

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.590
I'm always ready.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.680
Just help me sing.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.400
I can sing every song.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.050
Yeah.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.820
I am a talented singer.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:05.640
♫ At least even though we are apart, we still got to know each other ♫

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:12.800
♫ This is all I can give you as a gift ♫

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.320
Go!

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:18.210
♫ I just have to step back, let you go ♫

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:22.380
♫ To move on, someone has to give up ♫

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.160
♫ The pain's too deep for me to say, and you don't say it ♫

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.220
♫ I couldn't bear it anymore and lowered my head ♫

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.160
♫ I just have to step back, let you go ♫

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:38.210
♫ To move on, someone has to give up ♫

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.320
♫ to start over ♫

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:51.530
♫ It's better to endure just to smile for her ♫

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.310
Arm.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.700
Top up my drink.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.140
Jerk Arm!

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.540
Damn.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.920
We started with three, but now there's just two.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.120
From two down to one.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320
Damn.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.250
They ditched me again.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:17.350
What?

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:00.620
Yot.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.210
Yot!

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.090
Do you see a lighter?

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.810
Shit, I can't take it anymore.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:56.680
Yot.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.690
Yot.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.320
Yot.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:21.700
Yot!
